I am an Assistant Professor (starting Summer 2020) at University of
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) in The Department of Computer Science
and Engineering. My research interests are in concurrency:
programming, modeling, testing, and architecture. In particular, I am
interested in exploring new programming models that enable development
of correct and efficient applications on interesting (i.e. new or
emerging) architectures.

I see GPGPU programming as pragmatic avenue to explore different ideas
in concurrency (and also programming GPUs is fun!).
Given this, much of my work is framed using GPGPU. I am an invited
individual contributer to the Khronos Group where we think about how
to evolve official standards.


**I am currently looking for PhD students; please message me if the above description interests you!!**


Previously, I was a Post Doc at Princeton working in [Margaret Martonosi](http://www.princeton.edu/~mrm/)'s
group. I received my PhD from the 
[Multicore Programming Group](http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial College London supervised
by Alastair Donaldson. Even earlier, I worked with Ganesh Gopalakrishnan
and Zvonimir Rakamaric at University of Utah for my undergad and MS.
